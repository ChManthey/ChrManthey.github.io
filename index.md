## About Me

I am a third year PhD student in the evolutionary biology group of [Jens Rolff](https://www.bcp.fu-berlin.de/en/biologie/arbeitsgruppen/zoologie/ag_rolff/people/rolff/index.html).
I am interested in the evolution of metamorphosis in insects. Holometabolous insects drastically reconstruct their entire body. That reconstruction gives the insect the unique opportunity to drive an almost complete change between the larval and adult microbiota. Further holometaboly decouples growth and differentiation and therefore facilitates fast growth.
